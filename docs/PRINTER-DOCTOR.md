# Printer Doctor

Printer Doctor is a native PowerShell tool for the Atlas PC Support panel. It replaces the Streamlit prototype idea with a dependency-free Windows diagnostic flow that runs inside the existing launcher.

## Purpose

Use it when a customer reports printer problems and you need a quick, safe triage before promising a driver reinstall or Windows repair.

It checks:

- Installed printers and default printer.
- Printer ports, host/IP, protocol and drivers.
- Print Spooler service state.
- Current print jobs / stuck queue.
- Network ping to printer IP or hostname.
- Recent PrintService / Print Spooler warnings and errors.
- HTML/TXT report export for customer handoff.

## Safety model

Printer Doctor is read-only by default.

Repair actions are separated under **Repair actions** and require explicit confirmation:

- Restart Print Spooler.
- Clear all print queues.
- Open Windows printer settings.
- Print a test page.

Clearing queues and restarting Spooler can interrupt printing, so the tool asks the technician to type confirmation before making changes.

## Integration

- Tool file: `src/tools/Invoke-PrinterDoctor.ps1`
- Manifest id: `printer-doctor`
- Category: `diagnostico`
- External dependencies: none
- Admin: not required for read-only checks, but some repair actions may require elevation.

## Validation

After changes, rebuild and validate:

```powershell
pwsh -NoLogo -NoProfile -File build.ps1
pwsh -NoLogo -NoProfile -File tests/Test-ToolSources.ps1
```

Also parse changed PowerShell files with:

```powershell
$tokens = $null
$errors = $null
[System.Management.Automation.Language.Parser]::ParseFile("src/tools/Invoke-PrinterDoctor.ps1", [ref]$tokens, [ref]$errors)
$errors
```
